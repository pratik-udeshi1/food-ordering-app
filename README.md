## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Django
- PostgreSQL (or other database of your choice)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/pratik-udeshi1/restaurant-backend.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```
   cd restaurant-backend
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required packages:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Configure your database settings in `settings.py`. Make sure to update the database name, username, and password.

6. Apply migrations:

   ```
   python manage.py makemigrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

7. Create a superuser to access the Django admin interface:

   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

8. Run the development server:

   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Usage

1. Access the Django admin interface by visiting `http://localhost:8000/admin/` and log in with the superuser credentials you created.

2. Use the admin interface to manage restaurant data, including reservations, payments, inventory, reviews, and more.

3. To access the API collections, please provide API endpoints for each module, and describe how to use them with examples. Here's an example format:

   #### Reservation API

   - Endpoint: `/api/reservation/`
   - Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

   ##### Basic Usage

   - To create a order:
     ```
     POST /api/order/
     {
       "customer_name": "John Doe",
       "table_id": 1,
       "reservation_time": "2023-01-15T18:00:00Z"
     }
     ```

   - To list order:
     ```
     GET /api/order/
     ```

   - To update a order:
     ```
     PUT /api/order/{order_id}/
     {
       "item_id": {1,2,3}
     }
     ```

   - To cancel the order:
     ```
     DELETE /api/order/{order_id}/
     ```

Repeat the above format for each module's API endpoints.
